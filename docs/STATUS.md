# Status

## Current Phase

Week 1 foundation.

## Completed

- Repository concept defined.
- Name selected: FlowPilot AI.
- Initial documentation structure created.
- Roadmap drafted.
- Architecture direction drafted.
- GitHub repository creation and initial publication.
- TypeScript-first pnpm monorepo scaffold.
- Initial app folders for web, API, workflow service, execution worker, AI orchestrator, and observability service.
- Shared packages for event contracts, runtime config, and structured logging.
- Docker Compose infrastructure for PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, Redis, and Qdrant.
- `.env.example` with local development defaults.
- Initial RabbitMQ event contract types and documentation.
- `pnpm` installed locally and dependencies installed for the monorepo.
- `apps/api` converted to a NestJS API using the Fastify adapter.
- API configuration validation added with Zod and dotenv.
- API `/api/health` endpoint added.
- Swagger setup added at `/docs`.
- Prisma 6 added with an initial PostgreSQL schema for `Workspace` and `User`.
- RabbitMQ client module added with `@nestjs/microservices`.

## In Progress

- Week 1 backend foundation hardening.

## Not Started

- Auth and workspace HTTP APIs
- Prisma migrations
- RabbitMQ publishers, consumers, exchanges, and queue conventions
- Workflow definition model
- Authentication and RBAC implementation
- Frontend application UI
- LangChain integration
- RAG document ingestion
- Observability persistence and trace UI
- Tests and CI

## Verification

- `node -e` JSON manifest parse check passed.
- `docker compose config --quiet` passed.
- `pnpm -r typecheck` passed.
- `pnpm -r build` passed.
- `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://flowpilot:flowpilot@localhost:5432/flowpilot pnpm --filter @flowpilot/api prisma:validate` passed.
- `docker compose up -d` was attempted, but Docker daemon was not running locally.

## Notes

- Existing uncommitted change to this file marked GitHub publication as completed and monorepo scaffold as in progress before this session started. That change was preserved and expanded.
- Prisma was pinned to version 6 because Prisma 7 requires the newer datasource/client configuration flow, which is unnecessary friction at this stage.
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` is now generated and should be committed with the backend dependency changes.

## Recommended Next Step

Start Docker Desktop, run the local infrastructure with Docker Compose, start `apps/api`, verify `/api/health` and `/docs`, then add the first tested API slice for workspaces.

## Notes For Next Chat

Start by reading:

- `README.md`
- `docs/ROADMAP.md`
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/STATUS.md`
- `docs/DECISIONS.md`
- `docs/NEXT_STEPS.md`

Then continue with Week 1 backend foundation hardening and the first workspace/auth model implementation.
